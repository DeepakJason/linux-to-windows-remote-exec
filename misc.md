- Controlling Windows services remotely from a linux machine
  - ‚ùå PowerShell: Unfortunately, on linux, PowerShell 7 does not include cmdlets for:
    - Managing services (like `Start-Service`, `Set-Service` etc).
    - WMI services (like `Get-WmiObject`, `Get-CimInstance` etc).
  - Can PSExecSvc.exe be extracted and installed as a service remotely?
  - Use WMI?
  - Use .NET core?

    - Also, the `-ComputerName` options is no longer available in this cmdlets (starting PS 7 onwards).
